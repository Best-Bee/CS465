#Architecture

Compare and contrast the types of frontend development you used in your full stack project, including Express HTML, JavaScript, and the single-page application (SPA).
Why did the backend use a NoSQL MongoDB database?

The types of development used for the different parts of the application was quite interesting honestly, the layout and management of each part had a completely different feel and style so switching between which one I was thinking of at the time was surprisingly difficult because even though it was all organized, remembering how it was organized became an issue when each part was organized just a bit differently.

#Functionality

How is JSON different from Javascript and how does JSON tie together the frontend and backend development pieces?
Provide instances in the full stack process when you refactored code to improve functionality and efficiencies, and name the benefits that come from reusable user interface (UI) components.

JSON and Javascript are frankly completely different, in terms of appearance Javascript is more similar to Java than JSON, at least to me. JSON is more of a format in which you create data formats and files specifically for data, so you could have a JSON file that just has fields with their values for example. Javascript on the other hand is active, you have functions and the like in it so it's more similar to what most people think of as a "coding language".

#Testing

Methods for request and retrieval necessitate various types of API testing of endpoints, in addition to the difficulties of testing with added layers of security. Explain your understanding of methods, endpoints, and security in a full stack application.

The methods in a full stack application become exponentially more complicated the bigger it becomes as every time we create something there is a process of first testing it with a tool in the background with a barebones setup, then linking it to be functional throughout the application before testing it again, and finally making the visual changes in the application to format and display the change in a usable manner which we finally test one more time.

#Reflection

How has this course helped you in reaching your professional goals? What skills have you learned, developed, or mastered in this course to help you become a more marketable candidate in your career field?

I would say this course gave me a significant understanding of full stack applications and the content of the course will be invaluable to have in the future especially for portfolio purposes.
